Class & Objects
================
1- Class 
	- Defining a set/entity of members (attributes and operations) of 
	  the class itselft, the class's instances, or both.
	- Static class -> contains all static members

2-Members: Fields, Methods, Properties, Events
	- Field -> Store data for class (static field), the class's object (instance field)
	- Method -> Operate a task when being invoked.
	- Property -> Setter/Getter/Setter & Getter method
	- Event -> Signal raises to clients for providing operation to do any task.

Example:
	Calculating area of rectangle knowns its sides in OOP solution.
